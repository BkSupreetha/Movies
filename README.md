Have used Top rated movies dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/senthilkvggbn/top-rated-movies
this data contains 4 columns : Unnamed: 0,	id,	adult,	title
firstly i have renamed Unnamed: 0	as index and renamed indeex column name
then have cheked adult and non adult movies
checked for recurring movie names and dropped those rows
